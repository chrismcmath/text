DevLauncher
    -> Has Lobby and Battle discovery, which pass back data when they find anything.
    -> When rediscover is clicked, it'll update the DataContext Lobby items property thusly:
        Global.Instance.GetUIProperty<ItemList>("dev/lobby/_items").Value = _LobbyServers;


Discovery Client
    -> Has a UdpServer, listens to its data iwth OnServerResponse handler
    -> Upon receieving a response, it sends a processed version to its DiscoveryWatchers


UdpServer
    -> operates on another thread
    -> Loom allows a function to be called on the main thread (it is initialized at the top)
    -> Uses _Server (a System.Net.Sockets.UdpClient) 
    -> Has a delegate DataListener or when data arrives
    -> Listens to an AsyncCallback with OnReceived, gets data and restarts Receive after passing all data to listeners on the main thread


Questions:
    -> How is data being transfered from one screen to the next?
