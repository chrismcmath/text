Commands:

cd ~/ember
vagrant up (launch vagrant box based on settings in the Vagrantfile)
cd ops/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/local site.yml (Loads hosts/local and site.yml into the inventory, runs all scripts/functions under)


unity/Config will contain all lookups for where servers and databases reside. These will have to be changed manually on a server by server basis (eg local/database.json)
They also need to be synced with the values under ops/ansible (eg hosts/group_vars/db_node_servers)
