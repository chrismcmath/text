Pondering Playstyles

A giant that cannot hide in the forest 
    --> User can use them to fake their other squad's position
    --> Must have other advantage, eg Berkserker-style regeneration
    !!! How to show visually? Could look weird

Catapults lose a bit of health every time they fire (won't fire when health too low)
    --> Be strageic with use and placement
    --> Makes doctor more powerful

Units that are unaffected by terrain (flight) or inverse terrain (water is fast)
    --> Prevents grouping of squads
    --> Forces player to think more strategically about squad movement (speed, distance and route all factors)
    --> Allows greater variety of playstyles

Dragging ally's troop will allow you to drop a pin on the map with an icon inidacting the unit that was dragged.
This unit will appear on the ally's map, showing where you want them to move.
The ally can then drag the icon elsewhere, or delete it.
