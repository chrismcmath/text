Client- Visualization of line
    Requires line length, position (cursor) and type (forced, target)
    Needs to appear smooth when draw (no stutter, min move threshold), consistent (no bunched dashes)

Server- Logic of line
    Requires all(?) user input points,
    Needs to be able to get closest point intelligently, manipulate points of the line, update the Client line, integrate with pathfinding
