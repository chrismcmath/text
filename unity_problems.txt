When problems with unity arise, try:

Delete plist editor files (rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.unity3d.Unity*)
Delete Temp folder
Delete Library folder



Batching occurs between openGL draw calls:
glBegin(GL_LINES);
...
    glVertex3f(circle.x + k,circle.y - h,0);
...
glEnd();

Objects can only be batched if they i) have the same mesh and ii) have the same material (shader and texture)
