It appears like by the time the LineType is set from NONE to NORMAL, the _Type in the PathContainer has already been set to normal.


The binder has the property to set, but how to change it. 


Can't really put colour/alpha as an attribute in the DataContext as it is not to be used for any GameObject. Could potentially superclass Binder, but seems a little steep. Can't really do that as the color property exists on distinct data types.
