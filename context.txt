To route the request to the DataContext directly? Via the handler? Container using the CheckProxy?
Should be done via an Accessor, for now we'll do it all in the Container

Color and type:


Accessors and Controllers
Both used to act on a DataContext (although they don't have to)
Follow pattern of getting the property from the DataContext and then setting it.


Dash Container Storage Location:
Store path above squad in the hierachy (requires giving each PathContainer a refernce to the squad)
Modify world position directly
Modify world position through fragment (need to extend binder)
