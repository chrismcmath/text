/*
Design
*/

SQUADS have POWERS which allow them to create POWER_INSTANCES.
POWERS are essentially triggers in the Decision Tree that lead to the creation of POWER_INSTANCES.

POWER_INSTANCES can themselves have other POWER_INSTANCES
POWER_INSTANCES can have SENSORS which are sensitive to explicit groups

POWER_INSTANCES can either be one-shot affairs (melee hit) or recurring

POWER_INSTANCE can either be triggered by events, or are permanent (i.e. triggered at the start of the game?)
eg. The POWER of healing is a POWER_INSTANCE which is 

POWER_INSTANCE has a TARGET, which can be a Squad or Position

BUFFS have a timer on themselves. Thus, they can be given as part of a one-shot POWER_INSTANCE


Seems like Melee & Ranged attacks are to be isolated from this system. 


/*
Examples
*/

Berserker Regeration
The POWER at game start inits the POWER_INSTANCE which acts on the SQUAD and then re-adds itself at time+x seconds

Doctor
The POWER at game start inits the POWER_INSTANCE (HP++) which uses the SQUADS position and SENSOR, re-adding itself after

Tree Darter
Missiles can HAVEA POWER_INSTANCE on them, inflicted upon target reach
The POWER of poison darts (POWER_INSTANCE) leads to the creation of another POWER_INSTANCE (HP hit, movement deBUFF)

Cavalry
The POWER, upon certain line length, creates a one-shot POWER_INSTANCE which places a speed and damage BUFF on the SQUAD



/*
Questions 
*/

Should POWER_INSTANCES re-add themselves or should the Controller take care of this?

As discrete occurances, SPELLS are able to reused. Due to their continous time usage though, BUFFS require a factory to be made.


Triggers:
Receiving damage(?)
Dying
Standing still
Engaged by multiple squads
Buff-related - when certain buff is applied

Target: class-based, buff-based
