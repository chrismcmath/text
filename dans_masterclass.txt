Skinning

Skinning does not refer to texturing, but binding parts of the mesh to certain bones. Each node in the bone structure has a range of influence over the mesh which can be edited by a monochrome overlay.

IK and reverse IK, in addition with fixed points, are usually used to quickly create realistic animations.
