Used 

    SetupProperty<float>(PROPERTY_FADE_OUT, DEFAULT_FADE_OUT, OnFadeOut);

to deal with fade out, but this is actually quite inflexible. Better method is something like:

    _PropertyDefaultText = SetupProperty<string>(ref PathDefaultText, "defaultText", _Input.defaultText, OnDefaultTextChanged);

First argument is a null string that will get the full length of the property, so that we don't need to worry about the hierarchy of the JSON changing.  



UIRoot has child UICamera.
UICamera has an NGUIRoot, which is a DataContextDispatcher.


Problem is if I am to add a @ rerouter it will have to be to the UICamera, ideally before Reset is called. Considering it's currently called from Reset that's not going to happen with out a refactor.


At the moment we're just getting a single item, but we don't want that. We want the key, then the details

What is another example in the codebase where an array needs to be kept of DC info?
